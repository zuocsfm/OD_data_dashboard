OD-Vis includes seven panels. Specifically, Panel A allows users to filter the data according to departure time, travel duration, travel distance, and transport mode. The filters apply to all panels. Panel A also allows users to download the filtered results. Panel B is a title located in the top-middle of the dashboard and shows what the dashboard is about. Panel C lists some key statistics of the OD data. Panel D uses three interactive maps to show the locations of OD links, the activity stops, and the transitional stops, respectively. Moreover, users can hover over the map elements to obtain more details, such as person id and trip id. Panel E shows the number of trips with different transport modes in a bar chart. Panel F shows the filtered original OD data, such as trip ID, coordinates, travel time, and travel distance.
