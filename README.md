The Origin-Destination (OD) Data Analysis Dashboard includes seven panels. There are a title panel, key information panels, map panels, travel mode panel, and data panel in the middle from top to bottom. The key information panel listed key statistics of the OD data, including the number of trips, number of legs, number of agents, average travel time, average routed distance, and average speed. The three maps show the location of origin-destination of each OD pair, the activity stops of agents, and transitional stops respectively. The travel mode panel shows the number of travel modes each hour. The data table shows the detailed information in case it is needed. Moreover, the filter panel allows users to select a departure time range, travel duration range, distance range, and travel modes. 

The application is available at https://od-vis.streamlit.app/.
